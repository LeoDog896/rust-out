## FAQ

### What? Isn't this made in rust? Why is it called rust-out?

Yes, it is made in rust. Rust-in sounds weird, so I called it rust-out.

### You can't just turn rust on and off, no matter how hard you try.

I know, but I can turn lights on and off.

### Why is this a CLI?

I don't know. I just wanted to make a CLI.

### Lights out isn't a "smash game".
